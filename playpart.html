            MANDERS. What do you mean by that?<br><br>
            
            MRS. ALVING. [Drumming on the window frame.] I ought never to have
            concealed the facts of Alving's life. But at that time I dared not
            do anything else--I was afraid, partly on my own account. I was such a
            coward.<br><br>
            
            MANDERS. A coward?<br><br>
            
            MRS. ALVING. If people had come to know anything, they would have
            said--"Poor man! with a runaway wife, no wonder he kicks over the
            traces."<br><br>
            
            MANDERS. Such remarks might have been made with a certain show of right.<br><br>
            
            MRS. ALVING. [Looking steadily at him.] If I were what I ought to be, I
            should go to Oswald and say, "Listen, my boy: your father led a vicious
            life--"<br><br>
            
            MANDERS. Merciful heavens--!<br><br>
